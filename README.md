# Map-It
it‚Äôs tedious to copy a street address to the clipboard and bring up a map of it on Google Maps. You could take a few steps out of this task by writing a simple script to automatically launch the map in your browser using the contents of your clipboard. This way, you only have to copy the address to a clipboard and run the script, and the map will be loaded for you.

This is what your program does:

- Gets a street address from the command line arguments or clipboard.

- Opens the web browser to the Google Maps page for the address.

## Language used
- üêç python

### Note:
the script will use the command line arguments instead of the clip- board. If there are no command line arguments, then the program will know to use the contents of the clipboard.

### But How to run them ? ü§®
- most of the stuff will be plain python scripts which will only require you to have **python installed on your device** and an **IDE/text editor** to see and make changes to the scripts on your system.
- if you don't have python on your machine then you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
